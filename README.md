Engineering Design and Analysis Final Project on Climate Change Data 

Question 1: Find the weekly average temperatures for each year and report which week of each year had the lowest and 
highest average temperature. Count the number of weeks where the weekly average temperature was below 50 degrees 
fahrenheit for each year.

Question 2: Perform a t-test to determine whether the weekly averages for 2018 and 2023 are equivalent or not. Clearly 
report the p-value for the t-test and make a clear determination as to whether they are equal or not. Calculate the 
temperature error for the dataset where error is expressed as the difference between 2018 and 2023 temperature data. 
Fit this error distribution to a normal curve and plot a histogram of the data on the same plot showing the fitted 
normal curve. Include appropriate labels, titles, and legends.

Question 3: Calculate when the weekly average has changed by 20 percent or more week to week.
